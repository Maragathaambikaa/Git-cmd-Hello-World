BRANCHING
1. First main creared as a default branch and then
2. I created a readme-edits branch.Now,I am doing changes in readme ...- and
3. This change is only applied to this readme branch alone and not affects the main branch
   
COMMIT
Then click on commit(to save changes)

PULL
After commiting the change - open pull request (heart of collaboration)

COMPARE 
you can compare the branches before pulling 

then review the pull request

MERGE
merging the edits made in the readme-edits to the main branch - the chnages made in the readme-edits will reflect in the main branch

Can alos create a new branch to so the chnages 

can also delete the readme-edits  

***If you want to make a new changes - repeat the same process.
